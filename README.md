# ReservedCSV
 
# Version 1.0

Version 1.0 includes two inputs, one for the reserved list (provided) and one for a CSV of your choice. This CSV will be searched for any reserved list cards and tell you which cards and rows they are.
The CSV list of cards should be only one column of card names. 
<br><br>
All you have to do is open index.html in any browser of your choice and you can find all of the reserved list cards in your csv!
<br><br>
(I'm sure this has other applications but it's all I'm using it for)
<br><br>
Also avaliable on <a href="https://jwolfcrafter.github.io/">jwolfcrafter.github.io</a>
